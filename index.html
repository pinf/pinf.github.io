<h1>PINF Platform for JavaScript - <a href="https://github.com/pinf">github.com/pinf</a></h1>

<p>The <i>PINF Platform</i> rooted in <i>JavaScript</i> is the result of many
years of work by <a target="_blank" href="http://ChristophDorn.com">Christoph Dorn</a> with a heavy focus
on <b>flexible toolchain design</b> so you can <b>change your mind at any time</b>. This has been a long-time solo
effort which I hope to gradually grow without compromising my specific vision for it.</p>

<p>At the core of the <i>PINF Platform for JavaScript</i> is the:</p>

<p><b>PINF JavaScript Loader</b> - <a href="http://pinf.github.io/pinf-loader-js/workspace/www/index.html">Optimized JavaScript Bundle Loader</a>
    <ul>
        <li>Source: <a href="https://github.com/pinf/pinf-loader-js">github.com/pinf/pinf-loader-js</a></li>
        <li>Demo: <a href="http://pinf.github.io/pinf-loader-js/workspace/www/index.html">pinf.github.io/pinf-loader-js/workspace/www/index.html</a></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>The loader is at the core of the platform and represents the <i>minimal footprint</i> for an instance. It provides a nestable URI-based
namespacing system used to load code bundles that implement all features of an application or system using networked modules,
components and services.</p>

<p>Putting a namespacing system that overlaps with the top-level-domain space at the core of the platform and thus each application
instance opens up a world of possibilities. It elevates application and system development to component orchestration around
pure data-based (vs code) system models that drive system manifestation.</p>

<p><i>Other aspects of the <i>PINF Platform</i> are evolving and will be linked when stable enough.<br/>
All other repositories at <a href="https://github.com/pinf">github.com/pinf</a> are considered <b>UNSTABLE with NO SUPPORT</b>.</i></p>
